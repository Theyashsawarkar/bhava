> *Bhava* (भाव) is Sanskrit for "feeling, emotion": what an emoji is for: the feeling behind the words.

bhava is the emoji picker for [Vyom](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vyom): one keyboard-driven panel that opens instantly, with live data, a preview and a key for everything. It runs on any compositor with the layer-shell protocol (sway, Hyprland, river, niri, Wayfire, labwc…). In [Vayu](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vayu), the desktop it was built for, it replaces wofi-emoji.

## Features

- Every Unicode 16 emoji in a **grid**, your recent ones first.
- A tab per category, and **one skin-tone setting** (`Ctrl+T`) applied to every emoji that has tones.
- A big preview with the name, shortcode, code points and keywords.
- `Enter` **types the emoji into the window you were in** (and copies it); `Ctrl+Enter` only copies.
- Names and groups from Unicode's emoji-test.txt, keywords from wofi-emoji (MIT): see NOTICE and tools/build-data.py.
- Keyboard first: every action has a key, shown in the footer; the mouse works too.
- Never freezes the panel: slow commands run in the background.

## Install

### Requirements

- [Vyom](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/vyom) 0.3 or newer (Python 3.11+, PyGObject, GTK 4, [gtk4-layer-shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk4-layer-shell), a Nerd Font)
- optional: wtype (typing the emoji)

### Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/bhava ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/bhava
vyom reload           # pick it up (or log out and in)
vyom bhava            # open it; run it again to close
```

Give it a key in your compositor, e.g. sway:

```sh
bindsym $mod+<key> exec vyom bhava
```

### Update and uninstall

```sh
git -C ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/bhava pull && vyom reload     # update
rm -rf ~/.local/share/vyom/plugins/bhava && vyom reload          # uninstall
```

## Usage

Open it with `vyom bhava` (or your key). Type to search; the footer always shows the keys for what's selected.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Arrows` | Move around the emoji grid |
| `Enter` | Type the emoji into the window you were in (and copy it) |
| `Ctrl+Enter` | Copy the emoji only |
| `Ctrl+T` | Change the skin tone |
| `Esc` | Close the panel |

Every Vyom panel also has `Up`/`Down` (or `Ctrl+K`/`Ctrl+J`) to move, `Page Up`/`Page Down` to jump, `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` to switch to the next/previous tool, and `Ctrl+Tab`/`Ctrl+Shift+Tab` (or `Ctrl+H`/`Ctrl+L`) to switch tabs, or `Ctrl` with the number shown on a tab.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing opens.** `vyom list` shows every installed tool, and why one is skipped (a missing requirement, or a Vyom that's too old).
- **It opened, then something failed.** Look for a `Traceback` in the daemon's log, `journalctl --user -u vyom -u vyom-daemon -b` (without systemd: `~/.local/state/vyom/daemon.log`), and [open an issue](https://github.com/Theyashsawarkar/bhava/issues/new/choose) with it.
- **No blur or rounded corners.** That's the compositor: on SwayFX, add `layer_effects "vyom" { blur enable; corner_radius 20; shadows enable }`.
